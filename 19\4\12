One decadent day, i played 'sekiro' for half a day.
Let's see,i killed some guys.
Genichiro Ashina ... their names are too difficult to pronounce.
Overall, it's a great game.
Its style is close to that of the Oriental swordsmen. Actually, I can't tell the difference between ninja and swordsmen visually. They both seem to be very similar.
But at their core, they are different.Here's what I think.
First, what wuxia advocates is not the recognition of pure values, but a kind of constrained freedom.
Ninjas did not follow a blind reverence for dogma, but a kind of obedience based on identification.
